# SPRT-TANDEM: what is it?
A casual introduction to the SPRT-TANDEM algorithm. (under construction)

## Introduction
SPRT-TANDEM is a sequential density ratio estimation algorithm originally proposed in the paper, "Deep Neural Networks for the Sequential Probability Ratio Test on Non-i.i.d. Data Series". The SPRT-TANDEM sequentially estimates log-likelihood ratios of two hypotheses, or classes, for fast and accurate sequential data classification.

While the technical details are left to the paper, we provide a casual introduction to our algorithm below.
